### Objective
This project demonstrates how to set up a home lab for Elastic Stack SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) using a Kali Linux VM and the Elastic Cloud platform. The project includes configuring an Elastic Agent, generating security events, analyzing logs in the Elastic SIEM, creating visualizations, and setting up alerts for real-time threat detection. The goal is to practice security monitoring and incident response techniques using Elastic Stack.

### Skills Learned
- SIEM Deployment and Configuration
- Log Analysis and Event Monitoring
- Security Event Alerting
- Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation

---

### Tools Used
- **Elastic SIEM (Elastic Stack)**: Security Information and Event Management
- **Kali Linux**: Virtual Machine for testing and generating security events
- **VirtualBox**: Virtualization platform for running the Kali Linux VM
- **Elastic Agent**: Collecting and forwarding logs from the VM to Elastic SIEM

---

### Conclusion
In this project, I configured Elastic SIEM with a Kali Linux VM to collect, monitor, and analyze security logs. Using **Nmap** to generate security events, I was able to query the logs, visualize the data, and set up real-time alerts. This lab provides hands-on experience in security monitoring and is a practical step toward enhancing skills required for a security analyst or engineer role.
